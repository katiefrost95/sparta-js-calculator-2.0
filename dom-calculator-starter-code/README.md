# sparta-js-calculator-2.0

## Brief
1. Git repo with Dev and Master branches
2. Me and Joe added as contributors
3. Finished README.md with brief, what went well, the  challenges and list of what you delivered
4. pull-request submitted by 9:00am tomorrow
5. The calculator should display the correct value for each button pressed in the browser
6. when the equals button is pressed you should display the result of the last entered calculation
7. the program should use functions, loops, DOM selectors and DOM events

## What I've delivered
I've delivered on all of them except number 6.

## The challenges
My biggest challenge is trying to get the equals sign to return the result. I've managed to really confuse myself with my coding and would love more time to fix all my problems because I'm not happy with how it is at the moment.

## What Went well

I started off well, managed to do the DOM stuff okay, the buttons respond when clicked so I'm most pleased that at least some of the calclator works
